PZEM EDL - PZEM Event Driven Library

This code implements communication and data exchange with PZEM004T V3.0 module using MODBUS proto
and provides an API for energy metrics monitoring and data processing.

    This is a small sketch that shows how to run a single PZEM004 instance:
    
     - create an event-driven UART Queue object
     - create PZ004 instance
     - attach UART Queue to the PZEM instance
     - mannualy poll for data
     - enable auto-polling
     - use call-backs

    1. Connect only ONE device to ESP32's UART port using default or any other custom pins
    2. Build the sketch and use terminal programm like platformio's devmon, putty or Arduino IDE to check for sketch output

        some time in the future, somewhere in about ~100 ms... Almost an eternity in CPU cycles :)
        When we checked our metrics for data and printed the result - request might be still on it's
        way to PZEM over serial line.
